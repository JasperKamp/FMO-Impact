# FMO-Impact

## Motivation
FMO is preparing to set up a comprehensive set of KPI’s to be able to convincingly demonstrate the alignment between its investments and contribution and the actual impact of their projects (ref. solution architecture impact domain v0.3.pptx). Of particular interest is the intended use of an ontological model of micro-services to enable the flexible composition of multi-level KPI’s. FourPoints have been asked to build an example (prototype) of such a setup that will generate and visualize a pre-determined KPI, in order to demonstrate the advantages (and possible drawbacks, lessons learned) of the ontological approach. Building this prototype can therefore be seen as a ‘Proof of Concept’.

## Scope
Although the prototype will focus on a single high-level KPI (‘greenhouse gas emission’), the following ‘products’ will be in scope:
-	The logic used, needs to be structured into micro-services and control-scripts to show the ontological model in action.
-	The technology used, needs to fit into the current BI-landscape and needs to be ‘future-proof’.
-	Visualization will primarily make use of QlikSense but will also create an Excel-sheet structured for use in the visualization framework offered by ‘sopact’.

## Assumptions
-	Source-data needed for the KPI, will be made available to the prototype before-hand. 
-	The logic to create the KPI out of the source-data, will be provided through the Excel-sheet that is currently used to generate the chosen KPI.
-	Visualization in sopact based on the Exel-sheet provided, will be done by FMO or by FourPoints after the initial three weeks.
-	The construction of the ontological approach will be subject to weekly discussion to ensure meeting the concepts’ requirements.
